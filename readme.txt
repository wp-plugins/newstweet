== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is it? =

NewsTweet is a sidebar plugin for WordPress users that uses the Twitter search API. Using AJAX, it checks for new posts containing a search term and displays them on your site.

= Why do I want it? =

NewsTweet was designed to help spread the word about your blog/band/cause/whatever. For example, if you are a band called "Burning Glaciers" you would use "Burning Glaciers" as the search term. Everytime a Twitterer posts about "Burning Glaciers" it'll show up on your site. The "Tweet It" link and the fact that lots of other fans are seeing the posts should encourage more people to participate.

= Is it difficult to install? =

Not at all. Download and unzip and drag the "newstweet" folder into your "plugins" directory. Then activate the plugin, add it to your sidebar and edit the search term. That's it. You'll need to have dynamic sidebars turned on.

= What about the look of it? =

NewsTweet was designed to inherit the styles from your page so that it would look pretty good with any theme. If you want to change anything, edit the nicely commented CSS file.

= Do you offer tech support? =

Not really but you can always email me at tim@thisistim.biz.

= Who do I thank? =

Me, Tim Resudek, and my brother, Todd Resudek. We are freelance designers/programmers that built this plugin in our spare time. My portfolio is online at http://www.thisistim.biz, Todd's is at http://www.tr1design.net.
